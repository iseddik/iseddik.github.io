This study optimizes investments in NVIDIA Corporation using stock analysis and predictive modeling. Data preprocessing and analysis are performed, followed by four modeling techniques: logistic regression, PCA, KNN, and LSTM. The LSTM model captures temporal dependencies for time series prediction. Results and investment strategies for NVIDIA stock are presented.
