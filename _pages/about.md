Welcome to my academic web page! My name is Iseddik. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. With a strong passion for AI and its limitless potential, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the field.

Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged with various AI projects and initiatives. One of my notable achievements is the development of an AI tool leveraging [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which focuses on teaching vocabulary in multiple languages while also evaluating writing, speaking, and listening performances. This project, which I initiated in March 2023, has not only helped in enhancing my own proficiency in English but has also contributed to the overall advancement of language learning with the application of AI.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have taken up leadership roles to further explore the exciting realm of artificial intelligence. Currently, I proudly serve as the President of the [AI Club](https://club.i2a.ma/) at [Mohammed Premier University](https://fpn.ump.ma/) in Nador. Through this role, I have fostered a vibrant community of students who share a common interest in AI and actively engage in discussions, workshops, and projects related to this cutting-edge field.

In anticipation of the future, I am pleased to announce my availability for an AI internship starting in February 2024, after my master's studies. I am excited to use my skills, knowledge and enthusiasm to actively contribute to the advancement and implementation of cutting-edge AI solutions.

I warmly invite you to delve deeper into my profile to learn more about my background, projects and contributions in the field of artificial intelligence. If you have any questions or potential opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or on LinkedIn. Thank you for taking the time to view my profile and I look forward to getting in touch with you in the near future.
