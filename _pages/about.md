Welcome to my personal page! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in data science and intelligent systems. My main focus lies in exploring the potential of future AI innovations and security measures, particularly through the implementation of Blockchain systems and peer-to-peer communication. Additionally, I hold the prestigious position of president at the Artificial Intelligence and its Application Club [I2A](https://club.i2a.ma/) at the esteemed [Mohammed Premier University](https://fpn.ump.ma/). Through this role, I actively engage in various projects centered around the integration of AI and security solutions in domains such as healthcare, finance, noise reduction, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. Join me on this exciting journey as we delve into the cutting-edge developments in AI and its transformative impact on tomorrow's world.
